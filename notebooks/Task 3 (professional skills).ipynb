    "Python has two main types of structure for the data, dataframe and series. You can think of it with an analogy to a matrix or a google sheets file, a series would be the column of the matrix including all the values of the same type and the dataframe would be the agruptation of two or more series (columns in our example), so it will be the whole matrix. \n",
